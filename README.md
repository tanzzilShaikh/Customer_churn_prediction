# Customer_churn_prediction
Predicting the churn rate of a company using a kaggle data set, using ML and making business decisions based on the power BI dashboard and the churn report.


This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including their demographics, services subscribed, and whether they churned or not. Two models were developed: Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and their performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
And in the end using power BI dashboard was used to see the characteristics, demographics and the services of the customers that affect the churn.
